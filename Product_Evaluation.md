# Product Evaluation
The evaluation of this project was centered around iterative feedback from our client and observation of our own work. This was important as the product was something that the client himself would be using and integrating into his own work.

## Interviews
Our primary method of evaluation was with meetings with our client. The structure of our meeting would be:
- Progress made since last meeting - were the suggested improvements from the last meeting implemented or were there problems?
- Discussion of new ideas to possibly be used in the product - this includes the validity of new ideas based on the complexity of their implementation and the relevance to the product idea. The client may have ideas of their own or may change the direction of the project based on their own situation.
- Finalisation of ideas to be implemented next - goals are set for the next meeting or stage in the project
After the meeting any concrete ideas were placed in a project file to be referenced when moving forward. Ideas that could be implemented were bookmarked by creating a task card in Jira.
This method ensured that our project would move in the direction that the client desired, and that they could monitor and approve the progress we were making. 

## Observation
As our client could not constantly monitor our progress we often evaluated our standing ourselves by observing our own project and seeing what we could realistically add that would be complementary to the core ideas of the client. If someone suggested an idea to add that the group agreed should be added, this idea was also added to the TODO file in our project repository, and a card created on Jira.

Both methods were supplemented by online contact through slack, where we could contact our client for additional insights.

## Using our findings
From our evaluations we now had a list of ideas in our project TODO file. This was used as a reference to expand the base of our project from once we had completed the MVP. As the ideas in the file were only placed if they were needed or wanted we knew that if we were completing tasks from this file we were moving in the right direction for our project - this was our work methodology when refining our project in the later stages of development.
